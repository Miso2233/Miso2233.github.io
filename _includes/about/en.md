Hello, I'm Miso

I study at the School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)

A cybersecurity student who loves tinkering, enjoys solitude, and likes reinventing the wheel

I'm currently self-studying algorithms and striving for programming competitions

I believe that for every child obsessed with the field of computer science, their heart is more or less permeated with an indescribable sense of loneliness

We prefer code over words

We prefer documentation over chats

The internet is our field, the keyboard our footsteps

Let’s keep moving forward, even if no one understands

> A thousand kinds of desolate wilderness, we take as our dream;  
> A journey of ten thousand miles, we take as our home.
